Scoial Media for Readers

By Suhaas Ravela (<suhaas@umich.edu>)

Start out with welcome page that will tell users to create an account or sign in, or browse as guest. 
    depending on those three options, the site will take the user to the respective page:
    - if create an account - take the user to the page where you can create an account, and once account is created, take them to "Your Reading Feed" with their name
    - if sign in - take the user to the sign in page, and then to "Your Reading Feed" which is already implemented into this
    - if browse as guest, take user to home page of the most popular books today (grab the book cover images from an API)
    (for the first two things, there should be a backend where this information is stored)
In create an account, the user should be able to upload a profile picture, which will also be stored in a database or backend or something like that. 


might need to create multiple html files and link them in order to do this?
